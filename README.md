### Commonly used tools for Red Teaming Engagements, Physical Security Assessments, and Tactical Covert Entry.

I am a strong believer that Physical Security is really underestimated.

In this list I decided to share most of the tools I currently utilize, along with a "ranking" on how important I consider them to be in the toolkit as far as their usage, where to find them, and in some cases I will also include some other alternatives.

### Quick list of items:

1. [Camera with high zoom](#1)
2. [Body Worn Action Camera](#2)
3. [Drone with FPV](#3)

5. [Reliable flashlight](#5)
6. [Borescope / Endoscope](#6)

Tool         | Purpose       | Usage| Where to find | Alternative |
------------ | ------------- |------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
<a name="1"></a>1. Camera with high zoom | Reconnaissance. When gathering intel on your target, and for reporting purposes for your client, you will want to use a reliable camera. With a long zoom camera, you may be able to check for cameras surrounding the building of your target, be able to spot the location of security guards, and possible gather info on the locks and perimeter, reducing the odds of being detected. | Must have. | Recommended: [Panasonic Lumix FZ-80 60x Camera](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Megapixel-20-1200mm-Stabilization-DC-FZ80K/dp/B01MS16V42) | There are other multiple alternative cameras in the market. One with a decent zoom, ideally over 30x Optical Zoom should work just fine.
<a name="2"></a>2. Body Worn Action Camera | Reconnaissance and own security purposes. It is a way or recording the full engagement and infiltration, and allows you to demonstrate to your clients how the infiltration was performed. | Must have. | Recommended: [GoPro cameras](https://gopro.com/en/us/) or the DJI Osmo Action camera | Alternatives: There are other cheaper alternative action cameras that can be used, however the videos may not have the highest quality or best image stabilization.
<a name="3"></a>3. Drone with FPV | Mostly reconnaissance. It can be used for scoping the perimeter of a building, see its surrounding area, check for cameras, blind spots, and possible fire escape areas that could be potentially used as an entry point. | Its not a "must have", but can really come in handy sometimes | Recommended: [DJI Mavic Mini 2](https://store.dji.com/product/mini-2) or the older Mavic Mini. | N/A |
<a name="4"></a>4. Two-Way Radios or Walkie Talkies | Comunication and Intel Gathering. You need to be able to comunicate efficiently with other members of your team when performing an engagement, plus using a radio it gives you the posibility of listening into any channels being used by staff or security on the premises, and listen for any valuable information or if any of your team members has been spotted. | Must have any means of comunication with other team members. | Recommended: [BaoFeng UV-5R](https://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-BF-F8HP-Two-Way-136-174Mhz-400-520Mhz/dp/B00MAULSOK) | Alternatives would be to just use cellphones and bluetooth headsets and a live call, however with this option you will not be able to listen to local radio chatter. A cell phone serves the purpose of being able to comunicate with the client in case of emergency. |
<a name="5"></a>5. Reliable flashlight | Self explanatory. | Often needed. | Amazon, Ebay, local hardware store | If you want to save some money, you can always use the flashlight of your cellphone, however some phones cant decrease the brightness intensity. |
<a name="6"></a>6. Borescope / Endoscope | To perform reconnaissance from under or over the door, take a peek inside and see what is on the other side of the door. It helps to prevent spending time trying to open a door which has nothing important on the other side, or to check for any security measures in place, and avoid tripping any of them by accident. | Often needed. | Recommended: [USB Endoscope Camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0836XWPJH) | There are a few other alternatives, varying in price, size, and connectivity options. |
<a name="7"></a>7. [A reliable Screw Driver with changeable bits] | Content Cell  | random,kefb, | ------------- | Content Cell |
<a name="8"></a>8. [A reliable multitool] | Content Cell  | random,kefb, | ------------- | Content Cell |
<a name="9"></a>9. A reliable set of 0.025 thin lockpicks set | Self explanatory. Cant pick locks without a lockpick set. | Must have. | Recommended to get a well known brand with good reputation and quality products. Some of those are: [TOOOL](https://www.toool.us/equipment), [Sparrows](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com), [Southord](https://www.southord.com), [Covert Instruments](https://covertinstruments.com) | No alternatives. You do not want a pick breaking inside a clients lock. Avoid cheap sets such as the ones from ebay. |
<a name="10"></a>10. A reliable set of 0.015 thin lockpick set | This is very similar to the 0.025 set, but you may also want to carry a thinner 0.015 or 0.018 thin lockpick set, for those locks that have a very narrow or thinner keyway, to be able to insert the picks. | Good to have. | Recommended to get a well known brand with good reputation and quality products. Some of those are: [TOOOL](https://www.toool.us/equipment), [Sparrows](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com), [Southord](https://www.southord.com), [Covert Instruments](https://covertinstruments.com) | No alternatives.
