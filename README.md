Quick Check-List of commonly used tools for Red Teaming Engagements, Physical Security Assessments, and Tactical Covert Entry.

I am a strong believer that Physical Security is really underestimated.

In this list I decided to list most of the tools I currently utilize, a ranking on how important I consider it to be in the toolkit, where to get them, and in some cases I will also include some other alternatives.


Tool         | Purpose       | Odds of using| Where to find | Alternative |
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
A long zoom camera | Reconnaissance. When gathering intel on your target, and for reporting purposes for your client, you will want to use a reliable camera. With a long zoom camera, you may be able to check for cameras surrounding the building of your target, be able to spot the location of security guards, and possible gather info on the locks and perimeter, reducing the odds of being detected. | Must Have | Recommended: Panasonic Lumix FZ-80 https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Megapixel-20-1200mm-Stabilization-DC-FZ80K/dp/B01MS16V42 | There are other multiple alternative cameras in the market. One with a decent zoom, ideally over 30x Optical Zoom should work just fine.
