### Commonly used tools for Red Teaming Engagements, Physical Security Assessments, and Tactical Covert Entry.

#### \*\*\**The links of the products may change with time, if so, just ping me on twitter so I can update them. I am not affiliated or sponsored by any of these companies, and I have purchase almost every single item from this list out of my own pocket based on needs for engagements. If there are any other items that are not on this list and you believe they should be, ping me on twitter and I can add them.\*\***

I am a strong believer that Physical Security is really underestimated.

In this list I decided to share most of the tools I currently utilize in authorized engagements, along with a ranking of their value based on their usage and if they should be in your toolkit, including where to find them, and in some cases I will also include some other alternatives.

Tool         | Purpose       | Usage| Where to find | Alternative |
------------ | ------------- |------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
<a name="1"></a>1. Camera with high zoom | Reconnaissance. When gathering intel on your target, and for reporting purposes for your client, you will want to use a reliable camera. With a long zoom camera, you may be able to check for cameras surrounding the building of your target, be able to spot the location of security guards, and possible gather info on the locks and perimeter, reducing the odds of being detected. | 10/10 | Recommended: [Panasonic Lumix FZ-80 60x Camera](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Megapixel-20-1200mm-Stabilization-DC-FZ80K/dp/B01MS16V42) | There are other multiple alternative cameras in the market. One with a decent zoom, ideally over 30x Optical Zoom should work just fine.
<a name="2"></a>2. Body Worn Action Camera | Reconnaissance and own security purposes. It is a way or recording the full engagement and infiltration, and allows you to demonstrate to your clients how the infiltration was performed. | 10/10 | Recommended: [GoPro cameras](https://gopro.com/en/us/) or the DJI Osmo Action camera | Alternatives: There are other cheaper alternative action cameras that can be used, however the videos may not have the highest quality or best image stabilization.
<a name="3"></a>3. Drone with FPV | Mostly reconnaissance. It can be used for scoping the perimeter of a building, see its surrounding area, check for cameras, blind spots, and possible fire escape areas that could be potentially used as an entry point. | 1/10 - Its not a "must have", but can really come in handy sometimes | Recommended: [DJI Mavic Mini 2](https://store.dji.com/product/mini-2) or the older Mavic Mini. | N/A |
<a name="4"></a>4. Two-Way Radios or Walkie Talkies | Comunication and Intel Gathering. You need to be able to comunicate efficiently with other members of your team when performing an engagement, plus using a radio it gives you the posibility of listening into any channels being used by staff or security on the premises, and listen for any valuable information or if any of your team members has been spotted. | 9/10 | Recommended: [BaoFeng UV-5R](https://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-BF-F8HP-Two-Way-136-174Mhz-400-520Mhz/dp/B00MAULSOK) | Alternatives would be to just use cellphones and bluetooth headsets and a live call, however with this option you will not be able to listen to local radio chatter. A cell phone serves the purpose of being able to comunicate with the client in case of emergency. |
<a name="5"></a>5. Reliable flashlight | Self explanatory. | 8/10 | Amazon, Ebay, local hardware store | If you want to save some money, you can always use the flashlight of your cellphone, however some phones cant decrease the brightness intensity. |
<a name="6"></a>6. Borescope / Endoscope | To perform reconnaissance from under or over the door, take a peek inside and see what is on the other side of the door. It helps to prevent spending time trying to open a door which has nothing important on the other side, or to check for any security measures in place, and avoid tripping any of them by accident. | 6/10 | Recommended: [USB Endoscope Camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0836XWPJH) | There are a few other alternatives, varying in price, size, and connectivity. |
<a name="7"></a>7. RFID Frecuency Detector | This tool is utilized for recon, to determine the frecuency of RFID badge readers, and determine what your target is using. By knowing if its high or low frecuency, it can help you configure your proxmark to scan and clone badges. Another benefit of these tools is that they do not trigger any alerts. | 6/10 | Recommended: One good benefit of the [Dangerous Things RFID Diagnostics Card](https://dangerousthings.com/product/rdc) is that its the size of a credit card, so it fits perfectly in your wallet for EDC use. | Alternative: The [RF Detector by ProxGrind](https://sneaktechnology.com/product/rf-detector-by-proxgrind-2) can be used as a keychain. |
<a name="8"></a>8. A reliable ScrewDriver with changeable bits | In some scenarios you may need to modify some of your tools, fix something, or disassemble something. | 8/10 | Recommended: [Wera Kraftform](https://www.amazon.com/Wera-05051024001-Kraftform-BithoCSLDing-Screwdriver/dp/B001HSNHM2) | Alternative: Any other screwdriver set will work just fine. Ideally a kit which can be portable and with different bits |
<a name="9"></a>9. A reliable plier multitool | Same as with the screwdriver set, in some scenarios you may need to modify a tool or fix something. | 8/10 | Recommended: [Gerber Plier Multitool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDPT9K) | Alternatives: any reliable multitool of your preference |
<a name="10"></a>10. Gaffer Tape | Content Cell  | random,kefb, | ------------- | Content Cell |
<a name="11"></a>11. A reliable set of 0.025 thin lockpick set | Self explanatory. Cant pick locks without a lockpick set. | 10/10 | Recommended to get a well known brand with good reputation and quality products. Some of those are: [TOOOL](https://www.toool.us/equipment), [Sparrows](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com), [Southord](https://www.southord.com), [Covert Instruments](https://covertinstruments.com) | N/A. You do not want a pick breaking inside of a client's lock. Avoid sets that are of unknown brands from ebay. |
<a name="12"></a>12. A reliable set of 0.018 thin lockpick set | This is very similar to the 0.025 set, but you may also want to carry a thinner 0.018 or 0.015 thin lockpick set, for those locks that have a very narrow or thinner keyways, and be able to insert the picks. | 8/10 | Recommended to get a well known brand with good reputation and quality products. Some of those are: [TOOOL](https://www.toool.us/equipment), [Sparrows](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com), [Southord](https://www.southord.com), [Covert Instruments](https://covertinstruments.com) | N/A.
<a name="13"></a>13. Tension bars | One of the most important things for a lockpicker. A good picker knows the value of using good and comfortable tension bars. | 10/10 | Recommended: [Covert Instruments Ergo Turner Set](https://covertinstruments.com/collections/lockpicks/products/ergo-turner-set) or [Sparrows Flatbars](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/ft5k.htm) | There are many other alternatives, varying in sizes and lengths. I stronly recommend having them in varying widths. |
