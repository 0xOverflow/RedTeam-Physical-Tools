# Red Teaming - Physical Security - Tactical Covert Entry Tools
List of commonly used tools for Red Teaming Engagements, Physical Security Assessments, and Tactical Covert Entry.

The reason I decided to create this list is mostly because I've seen multiple articles online, sometimes blog posts, and even videos where individuals who are in the field, but more than often I see EDC and backpacks full of tools, with not much explanation.\
I am a strong believer that Physical Security is really underestimated.

In this list I decided to list most of the tools I currently utilize, a ranking on how important I consider it to be in the toolkit, where to get them, and in some cases I will also include some other alternatives.
