### Commonly used tools for Red Teaming Engagements, Physical Security Assessments, and Tactical Covert Entry.

In this list I decided to share most of the tools I utilize in authorized engagements, including where to find some of them, and in some cases I will also include some other alternative tools. I am not providing information on how to use these tools, since this information can be found online with some research.

There are many other good cameras in the market. Try to get one with a decent zoom, any camera with over 30x Optical Zoom should work just fine.
<a name="polarized"></a>1.1 Polarized Camera Filters | Recommended: Any polarized filter that fits the lens of your camera. | Alternatives: N/A.
<a name="ba-camera"></a>2. Body Worn Action Camera | Recommended: [GoPro cameras](https://gopro.com/en/us/) or the DJI Osmo Action camera | Alternatives: There are other cheaper alternative action cameras that can be used, however the videos may not have the highest quality or best image stabilization, which can make the footage seem wobbly or too dark.
